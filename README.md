# <Kanban Board>

## Description

This project was created as an example kanban board for an agile team which incorporates a secure login function with JWT. The website allows users to login and then access the functionality of the kanban board. I built this project because it allowed me to practice incorporating Authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) into a fullstack application. During the project I learned how to build authentication on both the server and client sides of a web application.

## Installation

Run the command "npm i" in the terminal at the root level to install the npm packages for the project

## Usage

 The homepage of the website prompts the user to log into the website. When you click on the login page you are taken to a login screen which asks for a username and password. After logging in, you are able to see the full functionality of the kanban board. Once on this page, you can add tasks, edit tasks, and delete tasks.
